## Project Overview

GeoTestimonios Transfronterizxs is a living border-community storytelling project that reappropriates personal experiences through testimonies and literary narratives about life in the El Paso-Juárez border region. This work is a collaboration between border poet and author Gris Muñoz and academic and digital humanist Sylvia Fernández Quintanilla. It aims to record and preserve the lives, experiences, and voices of women from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds living in a particular border area affected by gentrification, lack of mobility, urban policies and changing ecosystems. It will increase awareness of the experiences of women living in the border region as a way to heal and create a trans-border community of solidarity. The project includes an interactive map and digital exhibit of the border region, allowing users to access partly through points in space and in different formats stories of the two border women creating this project, as well as other storytellers who record their own stories in the language/format with which they feel most comfortable.
